## I'm having difficulty installing SourceBans++, can you help me?

We would love to! But first, we would like you read through our [quickstart]({{< ref "docs/quickstart.md" >}}), [inquiries]({{< ref "docs/inquiries.md" >}}), and other [docs](/docs) first!
If you are still having problem after that, feel free ask for help in <samp>#help-support</samp> in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/4Bhj6NU) guild

## When will SourceBans++ 2.0 be released?

Next Summer in Valve Time&trade;

## I want to contribute!

That's great! You can help by taking a stab at the triaged [issues](https://github.com/sbpp/sourcebans-pp/issues) we have!
