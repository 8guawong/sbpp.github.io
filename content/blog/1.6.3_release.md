### What's new :sparkles:

- Plugins
  - <span class="label success">+</span> Discord: Listens for `SBPP_OnBanPlayer()` and the new [<samp>SBPP_OnReportPlayer()</samp>](https://github.com/sbpp/sourcebans-pp/blob/dbb8aeb0e3a7f204b24bf99766cf5e99ff13e86b/game/addons/sourcemod/scripting/include/sourcebanspp.inc#L104) natives and forwards it to the designated Discord webhook

  - <span class="label success">+</span> Report: Uses the new [<samp>SBPP_ReportPlayer()</samp>](https://github.com/sbpp/sourcebans-pp/blob/dbb8aeb0e3a7f204b24bf99766cf5e99ff13e86b/game/addons/sourcemod/scripting/include/sourcebanspp.inc#L84) to insert reports into the `submissions` table, reachable via `Admin Panel -> Bans -> Ban submissions`

  - Main: Per issue [#187](https://github.com/sbpp/sourcebans-pp/issues/187) and PR [#406](https://github.com/sbpp/sourcebans-pp/pull/406). Now whenever a banned client joins, it will mend the `IP` column with the corresponding value if the column is previously empty

  - Checker: Per issue [#188](https://github.com/sbpp/sourcebans-pp/issues/188) and PR [#398](https://github.com/sbpp/sourcebans-pp/pull/398). Checker now also support communication ban lookup and also available to admins upon client join


### Breaking Changes :boom:

- Native Namespace Change: Per issue [#414](https://github.com/sbpp/sourcebans-pp/issues/414). For SourceBans++ to not clash with the original SourceBans, we needed to change the include file from `sourcebans.inc` to `sourcebanspp.inc` and change all the calls & forwards to be prefixed with `SBPP`.
